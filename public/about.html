  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hi, I'm Sam, a web developer and a recent graduate from the University of British Columbia. I have a passion for creating beautiful and functional websites that meet the needs of the users and the clients. I have experience in using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like Bootstrap and React to build responsive and interactive web pages. I also have some knowledge of back-end technologies, such as PHP, Node.js, and MongoDB.</p>
  <p>During my studies, I completed several web development projects, both individually and as part of a team. Some of the projects that I'm most proud of are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="^1^">Portfolio Website</a>: A personal website that showcases my skills and projects.</li>
    <li><a href="^2^">Todo App</a>: A simple but functional todo app that uses React and Firebase.</li>
    <li><a href="^3^">Weather App</a>: A weather app that displays the current weather and forecast for any city in the world, using the OpenWeather API.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I am always eager to learn new skills and technologies in web development. I am currently exploring Angular and GraphQL, and I plan to add them to my skill set soon. I am also interested in web design and user experience, and I strive to follow the best practices and principles in these areas.</p>
  <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading, playing video games, and hiking. I also love to travel and explore new places and cultures.</p>
  <p>I am looking for a web development position that will allow me to apply my skills and knowledge, as well as learn from experienced developers and mentors. I am confident that I can contribute to the success of your company and projects.</p>
  <p>Thank you for visiting my website and for your interest in my work. If you want to get in touch with me, you can email me at sam@example.com or connect with me on LinkedIn.</p>
